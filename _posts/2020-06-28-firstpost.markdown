Hello!

The past month of June was very intense. The current version of `ParametricOptInterface.jl` is functional for `ScalarAffineFunctions` and `ScalarQuadraticFunctions`, after a long time developing it. Spent a few days writing tests and reviewing the code, and the current result is working well.

I've been learning a lot about software development during this program. It is particularly awesome the fact that while we are working on a narrowed project, I end up learning a lot of skills that have a very broad applicability. 

Currently I'm working on documentation and improving the code performance. Hopefully in the next post those things will be addressed properly.
