Hello!

This will be the last post of the series regarding my GSOC program.

As I wrap things up, the first thing to do should be to thank my mentors for the amazing past months that I had. The learning curve was steep and definitely rewarding.

The Github repository where I did most of my work is already moved to the JuMP's main repository, and can be found [here](https://github.com/jump-dev/ParametricOptInterface.jl), and the documentation is now [here](http://jump.dev/ParametricOptInterface.jl/dev/).

As a result of this project, we can now efficiently use parameters in optimization problems implemented with the `MathOptInterface.jl` package. There are still some other things to be implemented, such as a proper integration with `JuMP.jl` but I plan to keep working on this open source tool after the final GSOC submission.

It was a really amazing experience.
