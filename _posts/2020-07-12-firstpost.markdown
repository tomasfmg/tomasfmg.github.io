Hello!

As the month started, the major development was to start the documentation, which can be found [here](http://jump.dev/ParametricOptInterface.jl/dev/). As the weeks progresses, the documentation will naturally be updated.

I also started dedicating some time to performance improvements, using the incredible tool [`ProfileView.jl`](https://github.com/timholy/ProfileView.jl), among other really usegul functionalities available in the Julia language.
