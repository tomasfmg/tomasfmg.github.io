Hello!

After a successful second evaluation, my mentors recomended me to adhere more striclty to the [JuMP style guidelines](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/style/). I'll definitely do that.

Regarding the package development, several tests were added, and the code coverage increased a lot. It is now more robust, and will probably be less prone to errors.

One thing to notice is how time flies during this program. At the end of the month there will be the final evaluation and we should submit our code and docs. It has been an amazing experience, and I will definitely keep involved with it the next months to continue improving the package.

Now, the [documentation](https://tomasfmg.github.io/ParametricOptInterface.jl/dev/) is more complete, worth taking a look to see what is possible to be done now!
