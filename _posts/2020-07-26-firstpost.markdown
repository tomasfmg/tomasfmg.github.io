Hello!

We are now approaching the second evaluation. I've been developing the major tools in the package [`ParametricOptInterface.jl`](https://github.com/tomasfmg/ParametricOptInterface.jl), and started working in another fundamental one: retrieving dual values from parameters.
That will enable a more efficient implementation of several algorithms, such as the Benders Decomposition for example. Although a little tricky at first, I figured it out with the help of my mentors how to do it! 

The documentation has also been updated, with a complete example of what we can do so far with the package (except the duals, which are still being developed. Next time it will be ready :D).
